The Proliferation of Counterfeit Medication</li><li>Topic B - The Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis </li><h1>Topic A:</h1><p>Over the past decade there has been a notable rise in the proliferation of counterfeit medicines.The World Health Organization defines counterfeit medicines as</p><p>“One which is deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled with respect to identity and / or source.Counterfeiting can apply to both branded and generic products and counterfeit products may include products with the correct ingredients or with the wrong ingredients, without active ingredients, with insufficient active ingredients or with fake packaging.</p><p>However, the previous substandard / spurious / falsely labeled / falsified / counterfeit(SSFFC) terminology suffered from a lack of global understanding and was sometimes confused to be the phenomenon of substandard and falsified products with the protection of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Such medicines pose a threat to humanity as they do not cure any illnesses and may even cause patients’ situations to progressively worsen.Most LEDCs are the quarry markets of such medicines.One such case is that of diethylene glycol being packaged as cough syrup and causing hundreds of deaths in Bangladesh, Haiti, Nigeria, India, and Argentina.</p><p>Fraudulent or counterfeit medicines are relatively cheaper than their unadulterated counterparts, which has drawn several citizens into a trap.Not only do they deprive citizens of quality health care but also cause considerable economic losses: In 2006, $40 billion U.S.D.was lost to the drug counterfeiting business.Many pharmaceutical companies have lost their annual profits due to the allure of cheaper, counterfeit medicines.in fact, many patients look online to find cheaper substitutes.It is estimated that 50 % of fraudulent medicine that patients come in contact with are bought through an online portal.</p><p>With the impacts of globalization, tracking producers and sellers has proven to be difficult, especially in developing countries where security is weak.These medicines are counterintuitive as, Health being a major contributor to the development of human resources and development of a country, these medicines undo all efforts made by governments of these countries.</p><p>Though the mechanisms of the problem are diverse – different regions face different challenges – the proliferation of counterfeit drugs is truly a global public health issue that must be addressed with urgency. </p><h1>Topic B: The Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis</h1><p>Human rights in the Rakhine State of Myanmar have long been regarded as amongst the worst in the world.Forced labour, human trafficking, and child labour have become the norm in modern day Burma and the Burmese Military Regime have become notorious for their use of sexual violence as a method of asserting control and dominance over the men, women and children of Myanmar.This agenda is no stranger to the Third Committee, having repeatedly called upon the Burmese Military Junta to respect and recognise human rights.The Social, Cultural and Humanitarian Committee has further, in previous resolutions, 'strongly condemned the ongoing systematic violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms' and called upon the Burmese Military Regime 'to take urgent measures to put an end to violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.'</p><p>The current situation has been built over several key components, each of which need to be tackled separately.The first being the colossal humanitarian crisis that has broken out in the region.Food shortages, extra judicial killings and malnutrition are just the tip of the iceberg.The second key component to be analysed is the extreme xenophobic nationalist ideology being propagated by the Burmese Military Junta.On face value this agenda looks simple and straightforward but the technical intricacies, and consistent prior failures of the global community to combat the crisis at hand, makes this agenda one of the most complex and most urgent issues for both discussing as well as combating. </p><p>The international community must assemble and collaborate in order to create a definitive strategy to combat the evils of the Burmese Military Regime, and protect the lives of innocent stateless minorities.The question stands as; will we, as the United Nations, truly be able to tackle the conflict which has taken the lives of millions and risked the safety of millions more ?</p>");

// UNSC
commModals[2].setContent("<h1>Committee: Security Council</h1><h2>Agenda: Venezuela</h2><h2>Size: 15 - 20</h2><h2>Executive Board: Nandini Sanyal, Shreya Singh</h2><p>In 1998, socialist leader Hugo Chavez rode a wave of support to the presidency, promising popular democracy and equitable growth.After his death in 2013, Nicolas Màduro of the PSUV edged out a victory in the presidential elections but failed to anticipate the extent of a long overdue debt crisis: by 2014, Venezuela was in a recession.</p><p>Controversial economic and policy decisions have done little to develop the volatile oil - dependant economy's energy and resource sectors. Food and medical shortages have intensified since 2014 as the government struggles to address  a collapsing public health and education system. By 2016, inflation was reported to have reached almost 800%; in November 2017, Venezuela defaulted on a 60 billion dollar debt, confirming fears that it lacks the capacity to correct it's economic paralysis.</p><p>Furthermore, President Maduro's violent crackdown and subsequent  imprisonment of thousands of protesters as political prisoners has invited international outrage, prompting some to label the situation a 'humanitarian crisis'. Protesters accuse the president of attempting to undermine constitutional limits on the presidency; in 2017, attempts to erode the power of Venezuela's national legislature, the National Assembly, resulted in the creation of a new constituent assembly - one that would supersede the National legislature and rewrite Venezuela's constitution to consolidate power in the hands of its president. </p><p>Tasked with preserving the integrity of a democracy in crisis, the Security Council will explore a conflict unique to the ideological divide that has long defined Venezuelan politics.In the process, we will attempt to answer questions that drive some of the most pressing conflicts of this era: What makes a successful balance between populism and economic development ? How can international actors influence struggling regimes to exacerbate or ameliorate domestic crises ? And finally, how must the role of the UN change as the idea of democracy continues to evolve across the globe ?</p><p>NOTE : The security council is a double delegation committee.</p>");

commModals[3].setContent("<h1>Committee: United Nations Special Committee on Palestine(UNSCOP)</h1><h2>Agenda: Future of Palestine</h2><h2>Size: 30 - 40</h2><h2>Executive Board: Akanksha Sinha, Madhav Lavakare, Shivam Nanda</h2><p>The United Nations Special Committee on Palestine was created on 15 May 1947 in response to a United Kingdom government request that the General Assembly 'make recommendations under article 10 of the Charter, concerning the future government of Palestine'.The British government had also recommended the establishment of a special committee to prepare a report for the General Assembly.Five Member States(Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia) communicated to the Secretary - General the request that the following additional item be placed on the agenda of the special session: 'The termination of the Mandate over Palestine and the declaration of its independence.' The General Assembly eventually adopted the recommendation at its seventieth and seventy - first plenary meetings, and the UNSCOP was established on 15th May 1947 for a fixed period of 3 months(the report was to be submitted by 1st September 1947) to investigate the cause of the conflict in Palestine, and, if possible, devise a solution.</p><p>The Special Committee on Palestine will hold its first meeting at the interim headquarters of the United Nations at Lake Success, New York, on Monday, 26 May 1947. Presiding over the first meeting, the Secretary - General of the United Nations welcomed the Committee and spoke of the importance of its task.The members will receive the first three volumes of the 'Working documentation on Palestine' prepared by the 57 member Secretariat designated by the Secretary General.The UNSCOP will hold several public as well as private meetings until 31st August, 1947, the day on which the report must be signed.These meetings will take place in several locations, ranging from Jerusalem to Beirut to Geneva.The United Nations Special Commission on Palestine is set to reach Palestine on the 14th and 15th of June to investigate Palestine and gather further insight that is imperative in devising a foolproof solution to the situation.</p><p>It is in this emotional atmosphere that UNSCOP was discussing the fate of the Palestinians.The Arab Higher Committee was convinced that the independence of Palestine was not the UNSCOP’s main priority.Now, delegates, it is your responsibility as the leaders of various nations to come up with decisive and resolute actions to decide the fate of Palestine, and perhaps of the entire Middle East.</p>");

// ARAB LEAGUE
commModals[4].setContent("<h1>Committee: The Arab League</h1><h2>Agenda:</h2><li>Topic A - Status quo and future of Oil Market</li><li>Topic B - Unemployment in Arab League members</li><h2>Type: Specialised Agency</h2><h2>Size: 22 members</h2><h2>Executive Board: Abhisri Nath, Sugandhana Ahluwalia and Vidisha Madan</h2><h1>TOPIC A - STATUS QUO AND FUTURE OF OIL MARKET</h1><p>The recent oil prices have noted a drop off the three year high due to a classic imbalance in demand and supply leading to constant fluctuations of oil prices.Demand grew at a moderate rate due to overall economic slowdown around the world, however, supply continued to soar, resulting in a massive drop in Oil Prices.</p><p>US West Texas Intermediate has recorded a highest closing since 2014. The enormous numbers translate to a highest daily average since 1970 in terms of production of crude oil per barrel.Clearly United states is taking over the market that once seemed to be in the grip of the middle eastern countries.The countries like Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have been an integral part of the market ever since they have started as the founders of OPEC.Sixty five percent of the OPEC total of proven oil reserves are situated in the Middle eastern countries.This speaks volume of their potential in the market.There has been a monopoly of these countries which lead to maximum demand being diverted to these suppliers.However, with US emerging as a competitor in the global market, the Middle Eastern countries must look at revised plans and policies.The constant fluctuations of the oil prices have pushed the OPEC countries to begin with their curbing activities but the challenge remains.</p><p>The problem now, is how the Oil producing Middle Eastern / Gulf countries sustain their usual economies and general standards of living that they have been used to.This has had a similar cascading effect on the countries associated with them.The challenge now is how to address this issue without disrupting peace in those countries.</p><h1>TOPIC B - UNEMPLOYMENT IN ARAB LEAGUE ARAB MEMBERS</h1><p>High levels of unemployment are a challenge for the Arab countries’ economies and increasing unemployment over the past two decades has led to frustration among the population, especially the youth and women, due to perceptions of their roles in society.Women in the Arab countries have emerged as the main victims of a festering unemployment problem in the region mainly because of poor investment and social barriers.One of the numerous impacts of such a glaring gap in employment is the increase in the informal economy.This refers to untrackable economic activity.These jobs have horrible conditions, no benefits and negligible regulatory oversight.Youth unemployment along with other factors led to the protests and revolutions in multiple countries and the violent destruction of multiple regimes such as those of Tunisia, Libya and Egypt.</p><p>A recent report sponsored by the International Finance Corporation(IFC) and the Islamic Development Bank shows that the economic loss due to youth unemployment exceeds US$40 - 50 billion annually across the Arab world.This situation is typical in countries where education and training systems are not adequately linked to the skills required by the economy, including its most promising growth sectors.Youth unemployment in countries like Egypt, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen will rise in the future as a consequence of the current economic and social deadlock they are facing.</p><p>As a community that fosters the well being of its people and systems, whether in the social sphere or the economic sphere, we must address this issue at the earliest and bring in stability.It is us - the Arab League who sail into the glory of development.</p><p>For further queries about MUN, agendas or committee in general, please contact us at arableague2018@sanskritimun.in.We look forward to interacting with all of you.See you in April!</p>");
