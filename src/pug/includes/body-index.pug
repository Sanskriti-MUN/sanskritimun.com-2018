					h1 Welcome, Delegates

					p.
						Dear delegates and faculty advisors.

					p.
						It is my distinct pleasure to invite you to the seventh edition of the Sanskriti Model United Nations Conference, in the year 2018.

					p.
						Since the inception of Model UN in Sanskriti, we have striven to bring forth to the circuit a conference driven by passion, innovation and the spirit of collaboration. Year after year, we have been honoured and privileged to host some of the most intelligent minds of the current generation, in the form of high school students, collaborating with one another to create intricate policies, resolve crises and invest themselves in positions they have experienced only in the realms of their minds. 

					p.
						At the 2018 edition of the conference, we bring to you a diverse set of committees and agendas, ranging from the most pressing present day conflicts, to ideological wars which began long ago, in the pages of time, but continue to influence geopolitics today. We bring to you new ideas, fresh perspectives, but the continued standard of the Sanskriti Model United Nations Conference â€“ a standard which carries with it the love, respect and admiration of countless hearts in India and elsewhere. 

					p.
						I invite you to Sanskriti MUN, not just to be a part of our efforts to ignite the fires of public policy in the hearts of innovative students, but also, to mould the new shape the world is poised to take on today. Whether you are an experienced MUNer, or a novice starting out, I assure you, your ideas will find a place in Sanskriti MUN. 

					p.
						I hope to see you in April, and I wish you all the very best. 



					p Sincerely,

					p
